# Fullstack-BadBank
A  fullstack banking application without security 

Description: This application is a fullstack banking application called BadBank, its called BadBank because it has no security authentication (So ill advise you dont enter actual email addresses and passwords into it). This application is able to manage state and User Interface with React, the UI has componenets (NavBar and Cards) imported from bootstrap. It manages API calls with Express and uses Node as webserver while MongoDB is used as a datastore.

Motivation: This application solves the big problem in the banking industry. Bank customers usually want accesss to their money when they want it, banks in general are not able to meet these demands because they cannot opertate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week so this application will put the bank in the palm of the customers hands. They can have access to banking services at anytime and in any geographical location provided they have access to internet. So this application was built to give the customer more convenience and unlimmited access to their bank.
